#' Calculate the fraction of convert events with overlap
#'
#' @description
#' This function calculates the fraction of convert events with overlap for each cluster.
#'
#' A convert event is an isolate where (1) the patient has no admission-positive
#' isolates, and (2) the patient had a prior negative surveillance before this
#' positive isolate. Criterion (2) is taken from the `prev_surv_neg` flag in the
#' lookup (see [get_isolate_lookup()]): TRUE only when a surveillance exists before
#' the isolate date and none of those prior surveillances were positive. Checking
#' the previous surveillance date alone is not enough, since that prior surveillance
#' may itself have been positive (meaning the patient was already colonized rather
#' than converting). Each qualifying isolate counts as one convert event, and a
#' convert event with an overlap explanation is a convert event with overlap. The
#' per-cluster fraction is `convert_events_with_overlap / convert_events`.
#'
#' The per-cluster counts that make up each fraction are also returned, as the
#' attributes `n_overlap` (convert events with overlap, the numerator) and
#' `n_converts` (convert events, the denominator). These let callers aggregate a
#' pooled, convert-weighted fraction across clusters
#' (`sum(n_overlap) / sum(n_converts)`) instead of averaging the per-cluster
#' fractions, which would ignore how many convert events each cluster contributes.
#'
#' @param cluster_overlap_df A data frame with overlap information for isolate pairs. For more
#'                            information, see [cluster_isolate_overlap()].
#' @param isolate_lookup A lookup table for isolates and their clusters assignments which has
