# Categorize cluster overlap

Labels each cluster by its likely transmission route, from the earliest
collected isolate among all patients in the cluster (the "index
isolate") and whether the cluster's other isolates have an overlap
explanation. The categories are:

- "patient-to-patient": if the index isolate is admission-positive and
  there is overlap explanation for all other converts in the cluster.

- "weak-index-patient-to-patient": if the index isolate is not
  admission-positive but is the first surveillance for the patient after
  admission and there is overlap explanation for all other isolates in
  the cluster.

- "missing-intermediate": if the index isolate is admission-positive but
  at least one other convert in the cluster has no overlap explanation.

- "false-negative-index": if the index isolate is not admission-positive
  but there is overlap explanation for all other converts in the cluster
  barring one (deemed to be the false negative index).

- "missing-source": if the index isolate is not admission-positive and
  there is no overlap explanation for more than one convert in the
  cluster.

- "multiply-colonized-index": if the index isolate is not in the cluster
  but is admission-positive, this is a "multiply-colonized index" if
  there is overlap explanation for all other isolates in the cluster.

- "multiply-colonized-index-missing-intermediate": if the index isolate
  is not in the cluster but is admission-positive, and at least one
  other convert in the cluster has no overlap explanation.

- "all-admission-positive": if all isolates in the cluster are admission
  positive, this is a special category that may indicate a common source
  or multiple colonization events, but is not explained

- "inexplicable": catch-all category for cases that do not fit into the
  other categories. Currently, index and overlap explanations are not
  enough to explain these clusters.

## Usage

``` r
categorize_cluster_overlap(isolate_lookup, cluster_overlap_df, surv_df)
```

## Arguments

- isolate_lookup:

  A lookup table for isolates and their cluster assignments with other
  relevant epidemiological information. See
  [`get_isolate_lookup()`](https://theabhirath.github.io/hospitraceR/reference/get_isolate_lookup.md).

- cluster_overlap_df:

  A data frame of per-isolate cluster overlap, from
  [`cluster_isolate_overlap()`](https://theabhirath.github.io/hospitraceR/reference/cluster_isolate_overlap.md).

- surv_df:

  A data frame of surveillance cultures, with columns `patient_id`,
  `genome_id`, `surv_date` and `result`.

## Value

A named character vector giving the overlap category of each cluster.
